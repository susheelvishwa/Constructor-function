# Constructor-function
constructor function


basic understanding about constructor function

# what is this 
so this nothing but a its a pointer based upon location its ceten object


# so function are first class cirizens of js
why 

1. functioon can show property on many things
2. can i assign function as a variable so *yes*
3. it also have methods

# what is call, apply, and wind 
evrythis is same the diffrence is how to call

# what is DRY principle
thats means dont repeat yourself 
ussing bind we can handle it


# how to make object




# what is a factory function
    this is secound way to make a object
    # explicity

# what is constructor function
    this is threid way to make a constructor function
    # implicity

    :- it is used to create dynamic object

    --> this
    1. create a new object

    --> new : it create new instance of object
    new keywaord do two this at a time its optmise the code
    2. also give return 


can we update const --> no, but
we change the property of the variable


example:

const studentData = {
    name: "susheel",
    position: "SDE-1"
}

so if i try to do this thing --> student = "string"

so it is not posible, but we can change property of the variable 

studentData.name = "pillu" so its posible
